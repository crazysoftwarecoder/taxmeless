# Where it Grows

Static site that simulates investing USD 1,000,000 for 10–25 years in 10 countries (AU, US, UK, CA, NZ, SG, UAE, DE, CH, IN) and shows every tax that bites at **ingress**, **growth** (each year) and **egress**, for equities and residential property side by side. Also shows GDP-per-capita growth and median family-of-4 expenses per country. Charts are clickable: a click opens a drill-down listing each tax with amount, plain-English rule, source URL and last-verified date.

## Task Management

This project uses **bd** (beads) for all task tracking. See `AGENTS.md` for full details.

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work atomically
bd create "Title" --description="Details" -t task -p 2  # Create issue
bd close <id> --reason "Done"  # Complete work
```

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — no markdown TODOs or task lists
- Run `bd ready` before starting work to check for unblocked issues
- Link discovered work: `bd create "Title" --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
- Use `--json` flag when parsing output programmatically

## Tech Stack

- Vite + TypeScript (vanilla, no framework), Apache ECharts (tree-shaken from `echarts/core`)
- zod schemas in `schemas/` are the single source of truth for all data shapes
- vitest for the engine; `scripts/validate.ts` is the data gate
- GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Cloud refresh loops: Claude Code scheduled routines; prompts live in `.claude/routines/`

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm run validate   # zod-parse every data/** file + cross-file checks + dry-run simulate
npm test           # vitest
npm run build      # tsc --noEmit && vite build → dist/
```

## Core rule

**All country knowledge lives in `data/**` JSON. Code never hard-codes a country value.** The engine (`src/engine/`) is a generic interpreter of `Rule` objects defined in `schemas/tax.ts`. Every researched number carries `meta.source` (https URL) and `meta.last_verified` (ISO date). Every tax rule carries `plain_english`, shown verbatim in the UI.

## Project Structure

```
data/            countries.json, assumptions.json, tax/{cc}.json, gdp/{cc}.json, col/{cc}.json
schemas/         zod schemas (meta, tax, gdp, col, countries, assumptions)
scripts/         validate.ts
src/engine/      types, rules (applyRule), simulate, compare, projections, __tests__
src/data/        loader.ts (import.meta.glob of data/**, parsed with zod)
src/ui/          app, state (URL codec), dom helpers, components/, charts/
src/styles/      CSS
.claude/agents/  specialist agents (see AGENTS.md)
.claude/routines/ prompts for the scheduled cloud refresh routines
```

## Specialist Agents

Defined in `.claude/agents/`. Delegate work to the right specialist:

| Agent | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| `tax-engineer` | tax rules per country, `schemas/tax.ts`, `src/engine/**` |
| `income-tracker` | GDP per capita / income series and projections (`data/gdp/**`) |
| `cost-of-living-tracker` | family-of-4 expense baskets, CPI (`data/col/**`) |
| `ux-engineer` | `src/ui/**`, charts, drill-down, responsive layout |
| `qa-engineer` | validate script, tests, CI/CD, routine prompts |

## Disclaimer

Not tax advice. Models a resident individual taxpayer in one representative sub-national jurisdiction per country, with fixed FX and nominal returns.
