# taxmeless

**Where does a million dollars grow best after tax?**

A static site that simulates investing USD 1,000,000 for 10–25 years in ten countries (Australia, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, UAE, Germany, Switzerland, India) and shows every tax that bites at **ingress** (buying in), **growth** (each year you hold) and **egress** (selling out), for an equities index portfolio and a residential investment property side by side. It also charts how GDP per capita is rising in each country and what a family of four spends there each year.

Every chart is clickable. A click opens a drill-down listing each tax with its amount, the rule in plain English, the primary source URL and the date it was last verified.

## How it works

- All country knowledge is data: `data/tax/{cc}.json`, `data/gdp/{cc}.json`, `data/col/{cc}.json`, `data/countries.json` (FX), `data/assumptions.json`. Shapes are enforced by zod schemas in `schemas/`.
- The engine in `src/engine/` is a generic interpreter of tax rules (flat, marginal schedule, allowance, fixed; with modifiers for discounts, holding periods, imputation credits and income thresholds). It never hard-codes a country.
- The UI in `src/ui/` is vanilla TypeScript plus Apache ECharts. State lives in the URL, so any scenario is shareable.
- `npm run validate` is the gate: every file must parse, every number must carry a source and a verified date, and the simulation must run cleanly for every country, asset and income band.

## Keeping the data fresh without a terminal

Four Claude Code cloud routines (prompts in `.claude/routines/`) re-research the data on a schedule and open pull requests: tax rules monthly, GDP and cost of living quarterly, and a weekly freshness audit. CI validates, tests and builds every PR; merging to `main` deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173/taxmeless/
npm run validate   # data gate
npm test           # engine + UI state tests
npm run build      # dist/
```

Specialist agents for Claude Code live in `.claude/agents/` (tax-engineer, income-tracker, cost-of-living-tracker, ux-engineer, qa-engineer). Task tracking uses [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (`bd ready`). See `AGENTS.md`.

## Disclaimer

Not tax advice. The model assumes a resident individual taxpayer in one representative state or canton per country, fixed exchange rates, identical nominal returns everywhere, no leverage, and a whole-position sale at the end. It compares tax drag, not markets. Rules change; check the source links and verified dates in the drill-down.
